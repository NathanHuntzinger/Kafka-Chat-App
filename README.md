This is a project for the HackUSU 2023 Hackathon. My goal for this project is to create an
implementation for Kafka and Elasticsearch. I probably wouldn't do this in a real project designed
for such a small scale, but I wanted to learn more about these tools and this seemed like a good
way to do it.
